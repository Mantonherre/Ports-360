# SmartPort Dashboard

Development:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173.

### Static assets

Additional files placed under `public/` are copied verbatim to the production
build directory. This repository includes an `ads.txt` placeholder so requests
to `/ads.txt` do not trigger `404` errors in the web server logs.
